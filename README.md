# TicTacToe_ConsoleApp
Tic Tac Toe, in a C# console app. In 2017 I researched Machine Learning, I had made a neural network in TensorFlow that played Tic Tac Toe; this console app was made to be able to play against it.

# How to play
Find the EXE under "bin/debug/TicTacToe_ConsoleApp.exe".

# Aftermath
(I didn't finish the project) When I quit, I was finding ways to plug the Python TensorFlow model into the C# app.
If I were to redo this code, I'd make it simpler.
